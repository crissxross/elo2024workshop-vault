## What are these data formats?

**Markdown**, **YAML** and **JSON** are all text formats that are easy to read and write.

The purpose of **Markdown** is to format text for the web. Both **YAML** and **JSON** are used for storing, transmitting and interchanging data and can be used in or with many different programming languages.

### Markdown

"Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for _writing_ for the web." - [Daring Fireball: Markdown Syntax Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

"Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents" - [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/)

### YAML

"YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages." - [The Official YAML Web Site](https://yaml.org/)

### JSON

"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate." - [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
