## Writing in Markdown

> Notes in Obsidian are stored as plain text files. This means your data is durable and not locked into a proprietary format. By writing your notes in plain text, they'll outlive any app—even Obsidian itself.

Obsidian supports the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax. Files in Markdown format use the suffix: `.md`  (e.g. `Home.md`) but the suffix is hidden in the Obsidian app.

> Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Markdown is a very simple syntax - for example, this:

```
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
```

produces, headings like this:

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

Here are some more examples of syntax:

```
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
==Highlighted text==
```

**Bold text**
*Italic text*
==Highlighted text==

```

Formatting code:

```
Inline text inside `backticks` will be formatted like code.
```

Inline text inside `backticks` will be formatted like code.

To format a block of code use triple backticks:

````
```
if (condition) {
  /* code to run if condition is true */
} else {
  /* run some other code instead */
}
```
````
