## Practical exercise

Explore a new project or story idea by creating notes in this Sandbox folder (or the root folder if you prefer).

### Suggested process

- Create a canvas note by clicking on the **Create new canvas** icon: ![[iconCreateNewCanvas.svg]]
    - Here's an example: [[Demo canvas.canvas|Demo canvas]]
    - [Canvas - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas)
- Then create a mind-map, ideas board or story map of a nascent project
    - Use cards, links, embedded notes, etc.
- Then create the notes - i.e. turn the cards into notes
- Create links between the notes according to your needs

### Alternative approach

- Create a Map of Content (MOC) note
- Outline your project, idea or narrative by creating links to notes that don't yet exist (or existing ones).
- Create the notes from the provisional links to expand on the idea
