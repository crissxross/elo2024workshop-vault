    - lexia: Why do they make them like this?
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Wish it was stretchy. Better for sitting all day.
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Horrible muffin top.

    - lexia: Stop it!
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Come on. Fingers on keyboard.

    - lexia: Does this shirt hide it? Pull it down. Cover it.
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Huh, fat chance.
      voiceType: InnerCritic
    - lexia: Come on. Focus.
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Too tight. Why the hell did I wear these chinos for work? Would anyone notice if I unbuttoned?
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Relief!
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Okay. Cost benefit...
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Now the zip's pinching.

    - lexia: The cost benefit analysis for Q3, how's it going? I need it ASAP.
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: Sure. Yes, Tracey. Nearly done.
      voiceType: HayleySays
    - lexia: Let me see the figures. How's it shaping up?
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: It's a bit over.
      voiceType: HayleySays
    - lexia: That won't do. You need to downsize somewhere.
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: Zip's going.
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: How about cutting some of this? That's excess to requirements.
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: But that's the carbon neutral...
      voiceType: HayleySays
    - lexia: Don't worry. Downsizing looks better.
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: Oh my god, there goes Cheryl from HR. What does she think she looks like?
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: A woman of her size should not be wearing clingy clothes.
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: Is she fatter than me?
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: So inappropriate, especially for the office. Does she ever look in the mirror?
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: Never look in the mirror.
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Ugh! Anyway, back to the figures...
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: I'll downsize, yes.
      voiceType: HayleySays
    - lexia: Downsize me. Fat chance.
      voiceType: InnerCritic
    - lexia: Good. We want a lean operation. Any excess smacks of inefficiency and we don't want that do we, Hayley?
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: No, Tracey.
      voiceType: HayleySays
    - lexia: She's looking at my belly. She thinks I'm inefficient.
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: So, when can I have it?
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: Soon.
      voiceType: HayleySays
    - lexia: Soon? Come on, Hayley. Clarity.
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: In thirty minutes.
      voiceType: HayleySays
    - lexia: No later. Keep it trim.
      voiceType: Manager
    - lexia: Yes, Tracey.
      voiceType: HayleySays
    - lexia: She thinks I'm fat. She saw me undo my waistband.
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: I'm unprofessional.
      voiceType: HayleyThinks
    - lexia: Belly blubber, ugh. I'll never be successful.
