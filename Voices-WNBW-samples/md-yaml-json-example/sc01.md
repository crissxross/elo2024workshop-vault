      lexia: Too tight. Too tight. Wish it was stretchy. Better for sitting all day.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Why do they make waistbands like this? Cutting me in half.
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: Disgusting blubber.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Come on. Fingers on keyboard. F7 to F21. Equals sum... cell ref?
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Horrible muffin top.
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: Worse than muffin top. Rolls and rolls of fat. Fat, fat, fat.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Does this shirt hide it? Pull it down. Cover it.
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: Huh, fat chance. Fat, fat, fat chance.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Copy formula... which sheet? Cost-benefit? No. Value chain analysis. Where's that?
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: This one, stupid.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Too tight. Too tight. Why the hell did I wear these chinos for work? Would anyone notice if I unbuttoned?
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Relief!
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Okay. Value chain analysis.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Now the zip's pinching.
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: Zipper teeth eating blubber
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: What's this? What..? Oh, pivot table.
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: Hunching. Like a blob. A fat blobby mess at a computer. Sit up straight.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: Hayley, a word?
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Oh no. Did she see?

      lexia: Sure.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: The cost benefit analysis for Q3, how's it going? I need it ASAP.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Sure. Yes, Tracey. Nearly done.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: Let me see the figures. How's it shaping up?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: It's a bit over.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: That won't do. You need to downsize somewhere.
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: Yeah, belly region.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: How about cutting some of this? That's excess to requirements.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Zip's going.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: Shave a bit off there.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Incidentals, yes.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: Oh my god, there goes Cheryl from HR. What does she think she looks like?
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: A woman of her size should not be wearing clingy clothes.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Is she fatter than me?
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: So inappropriate, especially for the office. Does she ever look in the mirror?
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Never look in the mirror.
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: Too fat and hideous.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: Ugh! Anyway, back to the figures...
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I'll downsize, yes.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Downsize me. Fat chance.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: Good. We want a lean operation. Any excess smacks of inefficiency and we don't want that do we, Hayley?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: No, Tracey.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: She's looking at my belly. She thinks I'm inefficient.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: So, when can I have it?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Soon.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: Soon? Come on, Hayley. Clarity.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: In thirty minutes.
    - voiceType: Manager
      lexia: No later. Keep it trim.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Yes, Tracey.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: She thinks I'm fat. She saw me undo my waistband. I'm unprofessional. Belly blubber, ugh. I'll never be successful.
