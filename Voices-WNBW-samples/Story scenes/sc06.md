      lexia: How can you see yourself with all this stuff draped over it?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Told you. I don't use it.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Can I take it off?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Whatever
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Come stand next to me.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I don't want to look at myself in the mirror.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Come on. It helps.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: How?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Come and stand with me in front of the mirror.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: No, no, no, no
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: What's there to be afraid of?
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: What's going to stare back at me?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: You never read fairy tales?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It's not a trick. It's just about getting comfortable with yourself.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Impossible
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It worked for me.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: What did?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I stood like this in front of the mirror and I took a long, long look at myself.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Ugh! My worst nightmare!
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I stared at my naked body.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Oh my god!
    - voiceType: InnerCritic
      lexia: Horrific!
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I made myself really look at my naked body in the mirror.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Awful!
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Every fold, every crease, every bulge. All the bits I wasn't...
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Why the hell did you do that?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Because... er... someone shared this technique with me, said it would help.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Who?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: A therapist.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: You've been in therapy?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Well, not exactly "in" therapy but yeah, a few sessions.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Why?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Long story.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: But why?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Like I said, I didn't know how to be in my body.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Like an out of body experience?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: No, no. I just mean, I didn't know how to be... at home in my body.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Because you're non-binary?

    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Yeah, I guess. I mean, when you're a teen, it's kinda hard when you don't fit the usual categories, the stereotypes, you know?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I get you.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Anyway, I made myself look (despite how I felt about it). I stared at my body...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Well, kinda staring at first, but after a while it was more like gazing.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: So I gazed at my body, every inch, until I could lovingly (compassionately) accept it exactly the way it is. This body.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I could never do that.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: You don't know until you try.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I'm not sure...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It was hard, not gonna lie. Probably the hardest thing I've ever done.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: But I knew I couldn't carry on the way I was, being so much at war with myself, with my body.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: And did it work? Were you happy with...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Ha! Happy? There's no magic mirror! No miracle cure. But it was a start, the beginning of a process...
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: I wish all mirrors would go smash themselves to smithereens.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: You should try it.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: No way! No. I'm not getting naked in front of a mirror.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Really. You should try it.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Uh-uh. Out of sight, out of mind.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: But it isn't though, is it? Your body's never out of mind.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: I wish I could be free of it.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I know because that's the way it was for me until...
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Yeah but you had different issues.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Sure but...
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Like you said, no role models.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: So the mirror works for you because you don't see yourself falling short of an ideal.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: What?! How can you say that? What about the whole binary gender thing?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: That you reject.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: You think that was easy?!
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: No. Just that...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: When I was a kid, everyone saw me as a girl. My parents wanted me to be a girl so much!
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: But it never felt right to me. Never.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: So when I was a teenager I automatically thought I must be the opposite. I wanted to be a man.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: And I tried, you know, to be completely masculine. But that didn't feel right either.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Of course not. You're non-binary.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: What I'm trying to say is, I automatically went to the opposite. I was still stuck in that binary idea.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Like there's only two genders?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: At opposite poles. Yes.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: But you're fine now. Look at you. You worked it out.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Yes, and the mirror technique helped me.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I just don't think the mirror thing would work for me.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It wouldn't hurt to give it a try.
    - ponder:
        - lexia: It would. I'm scared of what I'll see.

    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: How?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It helped me learn how to accept myself and be myself in my body.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I mean, this body, me, and how I am in the world.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Just consider it. Yes?
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Maybe I should try.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Do I really have to strip off?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Er... maybe not... trying to remember...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I think, maybe for my first time, I did it with my clothes on. So, whatever you feel comfortable with.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Comfortable? In front of a mirror?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Will you give it a try?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Hmmm...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It's up to you. No pressure.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Oh god... Okay, I'll do it.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Fantastic. So step in front of the mirror.

    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: No pressure, no pressure. Forget it. I just thought it might help. But obviously...
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Why do you think what works for you will work for me?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I don't. It's just... We're not that different.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Oh yes we are.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: What's that supposed to mean?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Nothing. We're different. Different people that's all.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: The difference is, I try to be here for you and you don't give a damn about...
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: What?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Me.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I do!
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: You think it's easy for me to go to bopo dancing alone?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: You want me to be just like you. Well I'm not.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Got that loud and clear.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I'm off. Gonna wiggle and jiggle my stuff with people who accept me as I am.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I accept you...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Actions speak louder than words, Hayley.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Okay, okay. I'll do the damn mirror thing.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: That's not the attitude...
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Oh I've got the wrong attitude now?!
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I didn't mean that. I meant, you've got to want to do it, Hayley.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I know and I do.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Do I?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Do you?
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Well, how did it help you exactly?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It helped me learn how to accept myself and be myself in my body.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: I mean, this body, me, and how I am in the world, the way I look.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Okay, I'll do it.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: But not naked.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Okay... now I think about it...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Yeah, I might've done it with my clothes on at first. So that's fine.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Okay.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Good.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Let's get it over with.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: So step in front of the mirror.
