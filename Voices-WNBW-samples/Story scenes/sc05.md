      lexia: Seriously. What's up?
    - voiceType: HayleySays

    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Dance class? I mean...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It's not really a class, Hayley, it's just bodies moving. Body positivity, yeah?
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: No, no, no, no.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: But I don't feel positive about my body.
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: You don't have to. I don't. But it doesn't matter, everyone's accepted.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: How can you know that?
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It's bopo!
    - voiceType: HayleySays

    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: Not for body haters
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: But you said you liked the idea. Before, when I found out about it. I thought you wanted to go.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Yes, for your sake... because, you know... I wanted to be supportive, but...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: Well, come along. Be supportive.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I want to but... I can't, Frankie. Not dancing in front of people!
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: They won't be looking at you.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: They'll be laughing at me.
    - voiceType: HayleySays

    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Sorry, Frankie.
    - voiceType: HayleyThinks
      lexia: They're so disappointed. I'm a shit friend.
    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: I'm sorry. I'd go with you if I could. I just can't...
    - voiceType: Frankie
      lexia: It's okay. I get it. I get it, Hayley. I do really.

    - voiceType: HayleySays
      lexia: Like you were in the wrong body?
    - voiceType: Frankie
