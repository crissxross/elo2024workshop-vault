    lexia: Lettuce leaves for lunch again, Shona?
  - voiceType: Shona
    lexia: Don't want to undo all my hard work. I'm so nearly beach-body ready. Just hope I've got a job to come back to after my holiday.
  - voiceType: Gabby
    lexia: Just rumours.
  - voiceType: HayleySays
    lexia: If you were in our department, Gabby...
  - voiceType: Gabby
    lexia: What's the point in worrying?
  - voiceType: HayleySays
    lexia: Downsizing, outsourcing...
  - voiceType: Shona
    lexia: We've all heard the whispers.
  - voiceType: Gabby
    lexia: Well, they can't axe your whole department.
  - voiceType: Shona
    lexia: Yeah. Think positive. It might not be us that gets the chop, Hayley.
  - voiceType: Gabby
    lexia: Focus on goals. You only fail when you stop trying.
  - voiceType: HayleySays
    lexia: Oh, give it a rest, Gabby. It's not a workout. It's work.
  - voiceType: Gabby
    lexia: Success isn't given. It's earned. On the track, in the gym, on the job. It's all the same.
  - voiceType: Shona
    lexia: Survival of the fittest.
  - voiceType: InnerCritic
    lexia: Flabby, fat, unfit for purpose.
  - voiceType: HayleyThinks
    lexia: Got to get in shape. Got to look the part.
  - voiceType: Gabby
    lexia: Aren't you eating, Hayley?
  - voiceType: Shona
    lexia: Have a skinny salad with me.
  - voiceType: HayleyPonders
    ponder:
    - lexia: Gonna skip lunch
