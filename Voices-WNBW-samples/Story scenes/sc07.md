- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Why can't I look in the mirror?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I know this sounds stupid, Frankie, but I don't want to look at myself.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I get you. I know it's hard. Just breathe in and out.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Now open your eyes and look into your eyes.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Shut tight.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I can't.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Okay. What's the easiest part of your body to look at?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Dunno... My feet?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Good. Start there. Look at your feet and take a deep breath.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Okay. Feet. Breathe in...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Don't hold your breath. Just breathe slowly, in and out, in and out...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Notice your toes, one by one...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Toes... toe, toe, big toe...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Now let your eyes move over the top of your feet, slowly...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: top of foot...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: to your ankles...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: ankles...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: and breathe... Now move your gaze up to your shins.
- voiceType: InnerCritic
  lexia: Fat calves.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Shut up!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: And slowly up to your knees...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Oh oh.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: and notice how they join shin to thigh.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Don't go higher!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Now slide up to your thighs...
- voiceType: InnerCritic
  lexia: Fat flabby thighs!
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: No. Don't like this!
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I don't like this.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: You don't have to like it, Hayley.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It's about getting used to looking at your body and accepting your body...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Fat chance.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: despite all the horrible thoughts and judgements you have about it.
- voiceType: InnerCritic
  lexia: Fat, fat, fat
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Stop it!
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: But I don't want the horrible thoughts!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I know. But the thing is, we can't get rid of our difficult thoughts and feelings.
- voiceType: InnerCritic
  lexia: Flabby fat.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Why not?!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: If we try to get rid of them or suppress them, they just get worse.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It's like trying to keep a beach ball under water. It takes so much effort to keep it down. And as soon as you loosen your grip it shoots back up again.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: So how did you learn to love your body?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I learned to accept it. There's a difference.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It's not about turning your body hate thoughts into body love thoughts. That doesn't work.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Why not?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Because it's like opposites attract. If I say black to you, what's the first thing that pops into your head?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: White.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Male?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Female.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: You see?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Yeah. So what?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Well, when you make yourself think positive thoughts, what happens is, they remind you of those negative thoughts you wanted to get rid of in the first place.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: So saying, I love my body reminds me that I hate my body?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: That's why I don't want to go bopo dancing!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I get that. But wouldn't it be fun too? All dancing together.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Yes but... all those thoughts! And positive thoughts turning into negative thoughts! No way!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: But what if you could go dancing and get to enjoy dancing and having fun with me even though the thoughts are still there?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: How could I?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: What if you don't have to focus on the thoughts? You don't get rid of them but you don't have to get swept up in them either.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: What if you can focus on the dancing, moving your body, enjoying the music, feeling the rhythm, sensing it all in the moment.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Sounds good, but...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: You know the (real) reason why I want to go bopo dancing?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Why?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Because I need to practice being comfortable in my body. You may think I've got it all sorted out, being non-binary, but it's not like that. It's a continual struggle ## continual struggle ??
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Some of the time, maybe lots of the time, I'm okay with my body and how I present.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: How you present?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: How I look, how I come across.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Got ya.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: But I can't control how other people see me and I still get comments, wrong pronouns, all that shit.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: It's tough. I feel you.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Yeah, it gets me down sometimes.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: And I still have those thoughts and worries about, you know, maybe I should just pick a side, you know, male or female. Ridiculous!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I know I'm non-binary but those doubts, those thoughts still pop up. And when they do, I just say to myself,
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: "Oh, I notice I'm having those binary straitjacket thoughts again."
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Or I say, "It's the old polar opposites story playing again." ## find better name
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: You make light of it?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Not exactly. But noticing thoughts and naming the stories I tell myself creates some space, some distance between me and the thoughts.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Stops me from getting hooked in that downward spiral where I start to believe what they're saying, like I have to pick a side.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: The way you did when you were a teen?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Yes.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I notice I'm having those unhelpful thoughts but I'm not trying to get rid of them or even argue with them. I just sorta make room for them.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Turns out, when I do that, I can just get on with what I want to do and be the way I want to be.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Sounds good.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Cool.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: So dancing. I can shimmy and shake my NB thing (and body pop) and all that rigid, polar opposite, male female stuff shakes loose.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Doesn't fall away completely but it doesn't stick to me and torment me.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I'm glad that works for you, Frankie. Don't get me wrong, it sounds great.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: But it obviously doesn't work for me.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Why not?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I can't even look in the mirror nevermind dancing!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Oh that's my fault, Hayley! I'm sorry.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I've really messed up with the mirror thing. I'm so sorry!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Tried to push you in at the deep end. So stupid of me!
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Hey, Frankie, it's okay. Don't beat yourself up.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: My therapist took it way more gradually with me. I'm realising that now.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I was just so excited to share what had helped me. What an egotist!
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: It's okay, Frankie. You wanted to help. I really appreciate that. Thank you, Frankie. I mean that.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: But I really don't think I can face bopo dancing tonight. Sorry.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Okay, Hayley.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Another time maybe.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Yes. Another time.
