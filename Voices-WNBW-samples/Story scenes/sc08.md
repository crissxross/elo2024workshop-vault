- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: So stupid! Why can't I look in the mirror?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I know this sounds stupid, Frankie, but I don't want to look at myself.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I get you. I know it's hard. Just breathe in and out. Now open your eyes and look into your eyes.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Shut tight.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I can't.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: What's the easiest part of your body to look at?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Dunno... My feet?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Good. Start there. Look at your feet and take a deep breath.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Okay. Feet. Breathe in...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Don't hold your breath. Just breathe slowly, in and out, in and out...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Notice your toes, one by one...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Toes... toe, big toe...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Now let your eyes move over the top of your feet, slowly...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: top of foot...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: to your ankles...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Oh oh.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: and breathe... Now move your gaze up to your shins.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Oh no. Don't like this!
- voiceType: InnerCritic
  lexia: Fat calves.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: And slowly up to your knees...
- voiceType: InnerCritic
  lexia: Fat knees, flabby thighs!
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: No!
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Can't do this.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: You can, Hayley.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I can't. I feel panicky.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Oh shit. Maybe I'm going too fast.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Slower would be worse!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I meant, maybe it's too much too soon.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: How does creeping up my body..?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Gazing at your body...
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Creeping my eyes up my body, how does that make me love it any more? It's horrible!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I'm sorry. This was a mistake. I've jumped a few stages. Thrown you in at the deep end.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Such an egotist! Thinking I could...
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Hey, Frankie, it's okay.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Like a pushy over-excited...
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Don't beat yourself up, Frankie.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I've really messed up. Probably put you off for good now. I'm so stupid!
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Hey, it means a lot to me that you want to help. I appreciate that. Really I do.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: But my therapist didn't rush into it like I just did, like a blundering fool. They took it way more gradually.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: But thank you for trying anyway. Thank you for caring. I'm so glad you're my friend. My bestie.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Thanks, Hayley.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: They look so deflated.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: So how does the mirror thing help?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Don't get wrong, I'm not gonna do it. I'm just curious.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Curious? That's good.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Is it?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Well, it's about getting used to looking at your body and accepting your body...
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Fat chance.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: despite all the horrible thoughts and judgements you have about it.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Because when you have a lot of body hate/dissatisfaction, like you and I have...
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: You? Aren't you okay with being non-binary?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Sure, but it's not like I've got it all sorted out. It's always challenging being different.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Even though most of the time I'm okay with the way my body is and how I present...
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: How you present?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: How I look, how I come across.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Got ya.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I can't control how other people see me and I still get comments, wrong pronouns, all that shit.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: It's tough. I feel you.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Yeah, it gets me down sometimes. And when that happens,
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I have those thoughts and worries about, you know, maybe I should just pick a side, you know, male or female. Ridiculous!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I know I'm non-binary but those doubts, those thoughts still pop up. And when they do, I just say to myself,
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: "Oh, I notice I'm having those binary straitjacket thoughts again."
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Or I say, "It's the old polar opposites story playing again." ## find better name
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: You make light of it?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Not exactly. But noticing thoughts and naming the stories I tell myself creates some space, some distance between me and the thoughts.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Stops me from getting hooked in that downward spiral where I start to believe what they're saying, like I have to pick a side.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: The way you did when you were a teen?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Yes.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I notice I'm having those unhelpful thoughts but I'm not trying to get rid of them or even argue with them. I just sorta make room for them.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Turns out, when I do that, I can get on with what I want to do and be the way I want to be.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Cool. Good for you.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Could be good for you too, Hayley.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: But I have different issues.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It's all about body image though, isn't it? Not that different.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: That's why looking at your body in the mirror could help.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: No way!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It's a way of practicing being with your body and allowing all the difficult thoughts and feelings to come up.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I don't get why anyone would want to have horrible thoughts and feelings.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: No one wants them but you can't get rid of them.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Wanna bet?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Oh yeah? How's that been working for you? Truly?
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Not so good.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Don't you find they get worse when you try to get rid of them or suppress them?
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Maybe.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Dunno. Haven't noticed.
### Do I need this metaphor if I'm using tug of war?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It's like trying to keep a beach ball under water. It takes so much effort to keep it down.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: And as soon as you loosen your grip it shoots back up again.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: You see, the more you're willing to open up to your difficult thoughts and experiences, the less likely you are to suffer from them.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: That doesn't make sense.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It does once you realise it's the struggling that causes the suffering.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It's like being in a tug or war with a monster.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Imagine there's a hole between you and the monster and the monster's pulling you towards the hole. You don't want to fall into it. What do you do?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I pull back, I pull away from it.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: And the harder you pull, the harder the monster pulls. How does that feel?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: I dunno... Exhausting... and scary.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: But what if you just drop the rope?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Drop the struggle?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Yes.
- voiceType: HayleyThinks
  lexia: Oh!
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Drop the struggle?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: They're only thoughts and feelings...
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: So that's how you learned to love your body?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I learned to accept it. There's a difference.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: It's not about turning your body hate thoughts into body love thoughts. That doesn't work.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Why not?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Because it's like opposites attract. If I say black to you, what's the first thing that pops into your head?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: White.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Male?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Female.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: You see?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Yeah. So what?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Well, when you make yourself think positive thoughts, what happens is, they remind you of those negative thoughts you wanted to get rid of in the first place.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: So saying, I love my body reminds me that I hate my body?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: That's why I don't want to go bopo dancing!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: I get that. But wouldn't it be fun too? All dancing together.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Yes but... all those thoughts! And positive thoughts turning into negative thoughts! No way!
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: But what if you could go dancing and get to enjoy dancing and having fun with me even though the thoughts are still there?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: How could I?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: What if you could drop the rope and enjoy the dancing?
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Focus on moving your body, enjoying the music, feeling the rhythm, sensing it all in the moment?
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Sounds good, but... Sorry, Frankie, I don't think I'm ready...
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Yeah, cuz I messed up! Being a pushy know-it-all!
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
- voiceType: Frankie
  lexia: Hmmm... You're right, yeah.
- voiceType: HayleySays
  lexia: One of these days, I'll go with you. I will. I promise.
