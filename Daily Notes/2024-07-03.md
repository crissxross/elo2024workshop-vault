# Wed 3 July

I created this is a sample daily note by clicking on the date in the **Calendar**, located in the right sidebar.

A daily note created in this way will be placed automatically in the `Daily Notes` folder and have the appropriate date heading (see `dailyTp` in `Templates` folder).

- The **Daily notes** feature is a core plugin - [Daily notes - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes)
- **Calendar** is one of the many available [Community plugins - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins)
