# Starting with Markdown

a flexible, extensible hypertext authoring system

---

- open file formats
- future-proof standards
- open web technology
- free software
- no proprietary lock-in

---

It all starts with writing in Markdown and using an open format writing application
such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

---

Markdown is a simple, plain text, markup language that's easily converted to HTML or other file formats.

---

> Notes in Obsidian are stored as plain text files. This means your data is durable and not locked into a proprietary format. By writing your notes in plain text, they'll outlive any app—even Obsidian itself.

 >...the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.

<small>(Kepano, CEO of Obsidian)</small>

---

In Obsidian, your data remains private, easy to retrieve, read, write and control because it's all stored in a folder on your local file system. 

Obsidian calls this a 'vault'.

---

A local-first approach

---

You can open the files in other tools too, making them easy to process:
- e.g. in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free, open-source, code editor

---

Other similar tools:
- [Logseq: A privacy-first, open-source knowledge base](https://logseq.com/)
- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) - "an open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool."
- [Foam | A personal knowledge management and sharing system for VSCode](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) - open-source
