Obsidian lets you structure your vault in any way you want:

- Folders - see [File explorer - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/File+explorer)
- [Tags - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags)
- Linking files - see [Internal links - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links)
- [Bookmarks - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Bookmarks)

## Maps of Content

'Maps of Content' (tagged `#MOC` in this vault) offer a more fluid organisational approach, using links as the main organisational tool.

## Three tag taxonomies

1. What type of thing is this?
2. What set does it belong to?
3. What state is it in?
