There a number of ways to turn parts of your vault or your whole vault into a website.

The easiest is [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) but it costs $8 per month:
- [Introduction to Obsidian Publish - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Introduction+to+Obsidian+Publish)

Here's a free open-source alternative but it takes more effort to set up:
- [Welcome to Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) - "Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites."
